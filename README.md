# FUTURE_CS_02
# Setting Up a Firewall

## Project Overview

This project aims to establish a firewall to enhance network security. It focuses on understanding the purpose of firewalls, exploring the different types, and implementing a basic firewall configuration on a virtual machine or network. Participants will configure firewall rules to allow or block specific traffic, ensuring that only authorized communications are permitted.

## Purpose and Types of Firewalls

A firewall serves as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, helping to prevent unauthorized access and attacks. The main types of firewalls include:

- **Network-based Firewalls**: Protect entire networks by monitoring traffic at the network level.
- **Host-based Firewalls**: Secure individual devices by controlling traffic to and from them.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need:

- A virtual machine or physical server environment.
- Administrative/root access to set up firewall configurations.
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/firewall-setup.git
   cd firewall-setup
